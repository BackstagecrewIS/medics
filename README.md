    b. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    
* Design Considerations
  - Colour Scheme
  
  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX The colour scheme reflects the fact that this is a simple pen and paper game, so the game mainly uses a black and white design. This is high contrast and easier to see for people with visual impairment.

  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX To make the control buttons more visible, they will be coloured forest green with white text.

  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX The messages tell the user the current player's turn and also the result of the game. These will be yellow text on a black background to differentiate them from the buttons.
  
  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX To highlight the cursor position during game play, the squares will change colour to pink when the mouse moves over them and return to white when the cursor moves out.
    
  - Typography
    
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX For simplicity, only one font style will be used. The Poppins font is a clear sans-serif font which works well for all elements of the game. The fallback sans-serif is specified in case the Poppins font fails to load.
    
  - Imagery
  
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX There are no images used in the game. The game board is simply a set of divs with borders set as required to make the traditional game board
    
  - Wireframes
